LMIC stack:

* Lua RTOS LMIC stack don't need to disable / enable interrupts.
* Now, if a thread call to join or tx, this functions are executed in the LMIC os_runloop thread and not in the caller thread.

Event Lua Module:

* Event API finished, this is the final proposed version.
* Added done function, for inform thread that calls to event's wait function that event is processed.
* Added pending function, for inform if all listeners have process the event.

PIO Lua module:

* interrupt function callback now informs about the pin value.
* deferred task for interrupt function must be run on the same core that interrupt handler is running (current thread).
* interrupt is disabled in the interrupt handler and reenabled when callback is done.

Signal management:

* Avoid call to xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR for manage signals. Now signal management are done with a queue.
* Now users can stop a running Lua script using Ctrl-C without any problem.


----

* Some bugs resolven in library.js when generating code from templates.
* After code generation for "when board starts" it's neet to wait for _eventBoardStarted event.
* Added "when digital pin changes at" block.
* Added "is being processed?" block.
* In "when i receive" block it's need to call to the event's done function.
